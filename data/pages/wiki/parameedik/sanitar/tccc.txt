Basic Management Plan for Care Under Fire

1. Return fire and take cover.

2. Direct or expect casualty to remain engaged as a combatant if appropriate.

3. Direct casualty to move to cover and apply self-aid if able.

4. Try to keep the casualty from sustaining additional wounds.

5. Casualties should be extricated from burning vehicles or buildings and moved to places of relative safety. Do what is necessary to stop the burning process.

6. Airway management is generally best deferred until the Tactical Field Care phase.  

7. Stop life-threatening external hemorrhage if tactically feasible:
  * Direct casualty to control hemorrhage by self-aid if able.
  * Use a CoTCCC-recommended limb tourniquet for hemorrhage that is anatomically amenable to tourniquet use.
  * Apply the limb tourniquet over the uniform clearly proximal to the bleeding site(s). If the site of the life-threatening bleeding is not readily apparent, place the tourniquet “high and tight” (as proximal as possible) on the injured limb and move the casualty to cover.
